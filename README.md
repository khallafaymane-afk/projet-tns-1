Project Overview : 

This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of Digital Signal Processing (DSP), particularly signal sampling, aliasing, and signal reconstruction.
Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we simulate continuous-time signals, analyze their frequency spectra, and study the impact of sampling frequency on signal recovery.

 Project Objectives : 

The main objectives of this project are:

Understand the difference between continuous-time and discrete-time signals

Apply the Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem

Analyze the effects of different sampling frequencies

Demonstrate the aliasing phenomenon when the Nyquist condition is violated

Visualize signals in both time domain and frequency domain

Reconstruct the original signal using an ideal low-pass filter

Use Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy) for signal processing simulations

 Project Content : 

The project includes several practical exercises:

Sampling of single-frequency signals
